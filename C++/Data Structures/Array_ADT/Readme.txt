This is an array data structure.
Array_ADT => Array as Abstract Data Type.
You have often used array as a primittive data-type but this is the abstract data type.
It means that we have coded functionality of an array as a user-defined data-type to understand its internal working.
This is often used an assigment/project either for OOP(Object Oriented Programming) or DS(Data Structure and Algorithms).
All the code is written by keeping Time Complexity in mind.
Hope you learn from it.
